Overview
>this project was based on creating the instagram profile layout,HTML was already prepared for us,we were only required to style the profile using the css.

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I feel confident in using Flexbox and Grid to structure web page elements. Implementing these techniques to align and distribute content was a highlight of my learning.
- **Responsive Design**: I successfully implemented media queries to ensure the page looks good on both desktop and mobile screens.
- **Styling Elements**: I was able to style the profile image, user information, and gallery section effectively, closely resembling an Instagram profile.
#### Challenges Faced
>>the challanges that i encournted which was very challenging it was aligning the boxes and also positioning the text within the box,as some of them were reacting otherwise.
>>and the method i used and the styling that i used the werent really that complex since alot of the css style it was something that we have used before,and we have applied some few styles on the o ther projects.

#### Areas for Improvement
>>CSS styling,i need to improve on Css styling learning new techniques of positioning and alighning text and other contents using different variables.
#### Overall Learning Experience
>>>my experience of learning thru this course was very challaneging because we had to apply the knowledge that we learned thru the videos and the modules and it was challenging for me to do all this work.
